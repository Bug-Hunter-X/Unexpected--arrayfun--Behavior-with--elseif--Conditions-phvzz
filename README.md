# MATLAB arrayfun Unexpected Behavior with elseif
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the usage of `elseif` conditions within functions passed to MATLAB's `arrayfun` function.

The issue arises when the function being applied element-wise contains multiple conditional branches. If not handled carefully, `arrayfun` might not correctly evaluate all conditions for each element. This can lead to incorrect results.

The `bug.m` file contains the buggy code, and the `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.m` in MATLAB.
3. Run the script. Observe the unexpected output.
4. Open `bugSolution.m` and run it to observe the corrected behavior.

## Solution
The corrected code in `bugSolution.m` addresses the unexpected behavior by restructuring the function to handle the conditions more clearly. Using a more structured logic or vectorized operations avoids the issues inherent with the `arrayfun` method.
